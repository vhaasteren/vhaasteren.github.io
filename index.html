            of the NANOGrav collaboration! Thursday, June 29th, 1pm EDT.

            Hello! I'm Rutger van Haasteren, a researcher exploring the
            intersections of theoretical physics, computational astrophysics,
            and machine learning. Currently, I'm a group leader at the Max
            Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein
            Institute, AEI) in Hannover, Germany, where my team contributes
            significantly to advancing pulsar timing array (PTA) science.
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            My academic journey began at Leiden University in the Netherlands,
            where I obtained my Master's and Ph.D. in theoretical physics. My
            doctoral research, supervised by Yuri Levin, focused on
            gravitational-wave detection and data analysis methods for pulsar
            timing arrays. I was fortunate to be involved early in laying the
            foundations for today's PTA projects, work that has since had a
            substantial impact on both the astrophysics and cosmology
            communities.
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            Following my Ph.D., I joined Bruce Allen's gravitational-wave group
            at the AEI, a group which initially focused on ground-based
            interferometers like LIGO and Virgo. Later, as an NSF Einstein
            Fellow at Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Lab in California, I
            concentrated on foundational data analysis methods for the North
            American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (<a
            href="http://www.nanograv.org">(NANOGrav)</a>) collaboration, part
            of the International Pulsar Timing Array (<a href="http://www.ipta4gw.org">(IPTA)</a>).
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            Afterward, driven by my interest in machine learning, I spent five
            enriching years at Microsoft as a senior data scientist, where my
            projects spanned language models, forecasting, Latent Dirichlet
            Allocation, and reinforcement learning for advertising
            optimization.
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            I then returned to AEI, partnering again with Bruce Allen to
            establish and lead a thriving research group dedicated to PTA data
            analysis methods and gravitational-wave detection. Our group now
            comprises five Ph.D. students, four postdoctoral researchers, and
            numerous visitors, all collaboratively contributing to improving
            algorithmic methods, workflows, and software tools that
            significantly enhance the scientific output of the international
            PTA community.
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            Beyond research, I'm passionate about Bayesian inference,
            statistical modeling, and the clarity that simple models bring to
            complex problems. Teaching and mentorship also remain central to my
            work—I deeply enjoy sharing insights, fostering curiosity, and
            igniting understanding in others.
        </p>

            This is me—Rutger van Haasteren: researcher, educator, and
            enthusiastic investigator. I invite you to join me in this ongoing
            journey of discovery.
