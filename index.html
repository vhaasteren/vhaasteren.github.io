            Watch out for the <a href="https://www.phys.ufl.edu/wp/index.php/2023/06/22/upcoming-nanograv-announcement/">press-release</a>
            of the NANOGrav collaboration! Thursday, June 29th, 1pm EDT.

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            Hello! I'm Rutger van Haasteren, a curious explorer at the
            intersection of theoretical physics, computational astrophysics,
            and machine learning. My journey has taken me from studying
            theoretical physics in the Netherlands to my current position at
            the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, otherwise known
            as the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), in Hannover, Germany.
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            My academic pursuit started at Leiden University, where I initially
            pursued theoretical physics. This path led me to earn my Master's
            and Ph.D., with my doctoral research focusing on
            "Gravitational-Wave detection and data analysis for pulsar timing
            arrays." under supervision of Yuri Levin. I was fortunate enough to
            be at the right moment at the right time to significantly
            contribute the groundwork for contemporary pulsar timing array
            (PTA) projects.
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            Post-Ph.D., I found myself at the AEI in Bruce Allen's group, which
            was primarily focused on gravitational-wave detection and analysis
            from ground-based interferometers like LIGO and Virgo.  From there,
            my journey took me to sunny California, where I joined the
            Caltech/Jet Propulsion Lab as an NSF Einstein Fellow. My tenure
            there was dedicated to foundational data analysis aspects of the
            <a href="http://www.nanograv.org">(NANOGrav)</a> collaboration: the
            North American PTA effort. Through NANOGrav I am also a member of
            the International Pulsar Timing Array <a
            href="http://www.ipta4gw.org">(IPTA)</a>
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            With an innate curiosity for machine learning, I made a career
            shift and spent five wonderful years at Microsoft as a senior data
            scientist. I worked on a variety of exciting projects, including
            text analysis using language models, forecasting, classification,
            Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and reinforcement learning for ad
            optimization.
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            Now, I'm back at the AEI, teaming up once again with Bruce Allen,
            who's recently been delving into PTA work. We are establishing a
            new group focusing on pulsar timing array data analysis methods and
            gravitational-wave detection.
        </p>

		<p class="lead text-justify">
            My work goes beyond the realms of physics and machine learning. I'm
            passionate about unearthing insights from data analysis, employing
            Bayesian methods, and sampling methods. Creating toy models to
            dissect complex problems is something that brings me joy. Plus, I
            have a genuine love for teaching; there's nothing quite like the
            reward of sharing knowledge and igniting the spark of understanding
            in others.
        </p>

            So that's me - Rutger van Haasteren. A scientist, a coder, and an
            educator, driven by my love for understanding the universe and
            sharing that understanding with others. I invite you to join me on
            this journey of discovery.
