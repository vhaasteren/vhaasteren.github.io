  abstract = {The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade and a half, adoption of Bayesian inference in pulsar timing analysis has led to increasingly sophisticated models. The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves by various pulsar timing array (PTA) projects highlighted Bayesian inference as a central tool for parameter estimation and model selection. Despite its success, Bayesian inference is occasionally misused in the pulsar timing community. A common workflow is that the data is analysed in multiple steps: a first analysis of single pulsars individually, and a subsequent analysis of the whole array of pulsars. A mistake that is then sometimes introduced stems from using the posterior distribution to craft the prior for the analysis of the same data in a second step, a practice referred to in the statistics literature as `circular analysis'. This is done to prune the model for computational efficiency. Multiple recent high-profile searches for gravitational waves by PTA projects have this workflow. This letter highlights this error and suggests that Spike and Slab priors can be used to carry out model averaging instead of model selection in a single pass. Spike and Slab priors are proved to be equal to log-uniform priors.},

In the literature, minimal assumptions are made about the signal and noise processes that affect data from these pulsars, such as pulsar spin noise.

Uninformative priors are not suitable for (noise) properties of pulsars in an ensemble, and they bias estimates of model parameters such as gravitational-wave signal parameters. Both frequentist and Bayesian searches are affected. In this article, more appropriate priors are proposed in the language of hierarchical Bayesian modeling, where the properties of the ensemble of pulsars are jointly described with the properties of the individual components of the ensemble.

  abstract = {Pulsar-timing data sets have been analysed with great success using probabilistic treatments based on Gaussian distributions, with applications ranging from studies of neutron-star structure to tests of general relativity and searches for nanosecond gravitational waves. As for other applications of Gaussian distributions, outliers in timing measurements pose a significant challenge to statistical inference, since they can bias the estimation of timing and noise parameters, and affect reported parameter uncertainties. We describe and demonstrate a practical end-to-end approach to perform Bayesian inference of timing and noise parameters robustly in the presence of outliers, and to identify these probabilistically. The method is fully consistent (i.e. outlier-ness probabilities vary in tune with the posterior distributions of the timing and noise parameters), and it relies on the efficient sampling of the hierarchical form of the pulsar-timing likelihood. Such sampling has recently become possible with a `no-U-turn' Hamiltonian sampler coupled to a highly customized reparametrization of the likelihood; this code is described elsewhere, but it is already available online. We recommend our method as a standard step in the preparation of pulsar-timing-array data sets: even if statistical inference is not affected, follow-up studies of outlier candidates can reveal unseen problems in radio observations and timing measurements; furthermore, confidence in the results of gravitational-wave searches will only benefit from stringent statistical evidence that data sets are clean and outlier-free.},

Here, we show that PTAs are also sensitive to mergers of supermassive black holes. While these mergers occur on a time-scale too short to be resolvable by a PTA, they generate a change of metric due to non-linear gravitational-wave memory which persists for the duration of the experiment and could be detected. We develop the theory of the single-source detection by PTAs, and derive the sensitivity of PTAs to the gravitational-wave memory jumps. We show that mergers of 108 M{$\odot$} black holes are 2 -{$\sigma$}-detectable (in a direction-, polarization- and time-dependent way) out to comoving distances of {$\sim$}1 billion light-years. Modern prediction for black hole merger rates imply marginal to modest chance of an individual jump detection by currently developed PTAs. The sensitivity is expected to be somewhat higher for futuristic PTA experiments with the Square Kilometre Array.},

Several gravitational-wave observational programs, called Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), are being pursued around the world.Here, we develop a Bayesian algorithm for measuring the stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from the PTA data. Our algorithm has several strengths: (i) it analyses the data without any loss of information; (ii) it trivially removes systematic errors of known functional form, including quadratic pulsar spin-down, annual modulations and jumps due to a change of equipment; (iii) it measures simultaneously both the amplitude and the slope of the GWB spectrum and (iv) it can deal with unevenly sampled data and coloured pulsar noise spectra. We sample the likelihood function using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. We extensively test our approach on mock PTA data sets and find that the algorithm has significant benefits over currently proposed counterparts. We show the importance of characterizing all red noise components in pulsar timing noise by demonstrating that the presence of a red component would significantly hinder the detection of the GWB.Lastly, we explore the dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio on the duration of the experiment, number of monitored pulsars and the magnitude of the pulsar timing noise. These parameter studies will help formulate observing strategies for the PTA experiments.},

In this paper we use the current data from the European PTA to determine an upper limit on the GWB amplitude A as a function of the unknown spectral slope {$\alpha$} with a Bayesian algorithm, by modelling the GWB as a random Gaussian process. For the case {$\alpha$}=-2/3, which is expected if the GWB is produced by supermassive black hole binaries, we obtain a 95 per cent confidence upper limit on A of 6 {\texttimes} 10-15, which is 1.8 times lower than the 95 per cent confidence GWB limit obtained by the Parkes PTA in 2006. Our approach to the data analysis incorporates the multitelescope nature of the European PTA and thus can serve as a useful template for future intercontinental PTA collaborations.},

Here we introduce an approximation to the full likelihood function for a pulsar timing array that results in computational savings proportional to the square of the number of pulsars in the array. Through a series of simulations we show that the approximate likelihood function reproduces results obtained from the full likelihood function. We further show, both analytically and through simulations, that, on average, this approximate likelihood function gives unbiased parameter estimates for astrophysically realistic stochastic background amplitudes.},

Current Bayesian searches use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which struggle to sample the large number of parameters needed to model the PTA and GW signals. As the data span and number of pulsars increase, this problem will only worsen. An alternative Monte Carlo sampling method, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), utilizes Hamiltonian dynamics to produce sample proposals informed by first-order gradients of the model likelihood. This in turn allows it to converge faster to high dimensional distributions. We implement HMC as an alternative sampling method in our search for an isotropic stochastic GW background, and show that this method produces equivalent statistical results to similar analyses run with standard MCMC techniques, while requiring 100--200 times fewer samples. We show that the speed of HMC sample generation scales as {$O$}⁡({$N$}5/4psr) where {$N$}psr is the number of pulsars, compared to {$O$}⁡({$N$}2psr) for MCMC methods. These factors offset the increased time required to generate a sample using HMC, demonstrating the value of adopting HMC techniques for PTAs.},

As a result, numerous scientific works have been published analyzing and further developing various aspects of the experiment, from performing tests of gravity to improving the efficiency of the current data analysis techniques. In this regard, we contribute to the recent advancements in the field of PTAs by presenting the most general, agnostic, per-frequency Bayesian search for a low-frequency (red) noise process in these data. Our new method involves the use of a conjugate Jeffrey's-like multivariate prior which allows one to model all unique parameters of the global PTA-level red noise covariance matrix as a separate model parameter for which a marginalized posterior-probability distribution can be found using Gibbs sampling. Even though perfecting the implementation of the Gibbs sampling and mitigating the numerical stability challenges require further development, we show the power of this new method by analyzing realistic and theoretical PTA simulated data sets. We show how our technique is consistent with the more restricted standard techniques in recovering both the auto and the cross-spectrum of pulsars' low-frequency (red) noise. Furthermore, we highlight ways to approximately characterize a GWB (both its auto- and cross-spectrum) using Fourier coefficient estimates from single-pulsar and so-called CURN (common uncorrelated red noise) analyses via analytic draws from a specific Inverse-Wishart distribution.},

  abstract = {A new model-independent method is presented for the analysis of pulsar timing data and the estimation of the spectral properties of an isotropic gravitational wave background (GWB). Taking a Bayesian approach, we show that by rephrasing the likelihood we are able to eliminate the most costly aspects of computation normally associated with this type of data analysis. When applied to the International Pulsar Timing Array Mock Data Challenge data sets this results in speedups of approximately 2--3 orders of magnitude compared to established methods, in the most extreme cases reducing the run time from several hours on the high performance computer ``DARWIN'' to less than a minute on a normal work station. Because of the versatility of this approach, we present three applications of the new likelihood. In the low signal-to-noise regime we sample directly from the power spectrum coefficients of the GWB signal realization. In the high signal-to-noise regime, where the data can support a large number of coefficients, we sample from the joint probability density of the power spectrum coefficients for the individual pulsars and the GWB signal realization using a ``guided Hamiltonian sampler'' to sample efficiently from this high-dimensional ( {$\sim$}1000) space. Critically in both these cases we need make no assumptions about the form of the power spectrum of the GWB, or the individual pulsars. Finally, we show that, if desired, a power-law model can still be fitted during sampling. We then apply this method to a more complex data set designed to represent better a future International Pulsar Timing Array or European Pulsar Timing Array data release. We show that even in challenging cases where the data features large jumps of the order 5 years, with observations spanning between 4 and 18 years for different pulsars and including steep red noise processes we are able to parametrize the underlying GWB signal correctly. Finally we present a method for characterizing the spatial correlation between pulsars on the sky, making no assumptions about the form of that correlation, and therefore providing the only truly general Bayesian method of confirming a GWB detection from pulsar timing data.},

  abstract = {Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently found evidence for a nanohertz-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). Constraining its spectral characteristics will reveal its origins. In order to achieve this, we must understand how data and modeling conditions in each pulsar influence the precision and accuracy of SGWB spectral recovery. These goals typically require many Bayesian analyses on real data sets and large-scale simulations that are slow and computationally taxing. To combat this, we have developed several new rapid approaches that instead operate on intermediate SGWB analysis products. These techniques refit SGWB spectral models to previously-computed Bayesian posterior estimates of the timing power spectra. We test our new techniques on simulated PTA data sets and the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, where in the latter our refit posterior achieves a Hellinger distance---bounded between 0 for identical distributions and 1 for zero overlap---from the current full production-level pipeline that is {$\lessequivlnt$}0.1. Our techniques are {$\sim$}102--104 times faster than the production-level likelihood, and scale much more favorably (sub-linearly) as a PTA is expanded with new pulsars or observations. Our techniques also allow us to demonstrate conclusively that SGWB spectral characterization in PTA data sets is driven by the longest-timed pulsars and the best-measured power spectral densities, which is not necessarily the case for SGWB detection that is predicated on correlating many pulsars. Indeed, the common-process spectral properties found in the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set are given by analyzing only the {$\sim$}14 longest-timed pulsars out of the full 45 pulsar array, and we find that the ``shallowing'' of the common-process power-law model occurs when gravitational-wave frequencies higher than {$\sim$}50 nanohertz are included. The implementation of our techniques is openly available as a software suite to allow fast and flexible PTA SGWB spectral characterization and model selection.},

  abstract = {In order to reach the sensitivity required to detect gravitational waves, pulsar timing array experiments need to mitigate as much noise as possible in timing data. A dominant amount of noise is likely due to variations in the dispersion measure. To correct for such variations, we develop a statistical method inspired by the maximum likelihood estimator and optimal filtering. Our method consists of two major steps. First, the spectral index and amplitude of dispersion measure variations are measured via a time-domain spectral analysis. Second, the linear optimal filter is constructed based on the model parameters found in the first step, and is used to extract the dispersion measure variation waveforms. Compared to current existing methods, this method has better time resolution for the study of short time-scale dispersion variations, and generally produces smaller errors in waveform estimations. This method can process irregularly sampled data without any interpolation because of its time-domain nature. Furthermore, it offers the possibility to interpolate or extrapolate the waveform estimation to regions where no data are available. Examples using simulated data sets are included for demonstration.},

While the source positions will likely be isotropic to a good approximation, the gravitational-wave angular power distribution will be anisotropic, with the most massive and/or nearby binaries producing signals that may resound above the background. We study such a realistic angular power distribution, developing fast and accurate sky-mapping strategies to localize pixels and extended regions of excess power while simultaneously modeling the background signal from the less massive and more distant ensemble. We find that power anisotropy will be challenging to discriminate from isotropy for realistic gravitational-wave skies, requiring SNR {$>$}10 in order to favor anisotropy with 10:1 posterior odds in our case study. Amongst our techniques, modeling the population signal with multiple point sources in addition to an isotropic background provides the most physically motivated and easily interpreted maps, while spherical-harmonic modeling of the square-root power distribution, P({\textasciicircum}{\textohm})1/2, performs best in discriminating from overall isotropy. Our techniques are modular and easily incorporated into existing pulsar-timing array analysis pipelines.},

The spatial separation of a network of interferometers, or of a single interferometer at different times during its rotational and orbital motion around the Sun, allows for recovery of both components. We derive expressions for the response functions of a laser interferometer in the small-antenna limit and use these expressions to calculate the overlap reduction function for a pair of interferometers. We also construct maximum-likelihood estimates of the +- and {\texttimes}-polarization modes of the gravitational-wave sky in terms of the response matrix for a network of ground-based interferometers, evaluated at discrete times during Earth's rotational and orbital motion around the Sun. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for some simple simulated backgrounds (a single point source and two spatially extended distributions having only gradient or curl components), calculating maximum-likelihood sky maps and uncertainty maps based on the (pseudo)inverse of the response matrix. The distinction between this approach and standard methods for mapping gravitational-wave power is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Decade-long timing observations of arrays of millisecond pulsars have placed highly constraining upper limits on the amplitude of the nanohertz gravitational-wave stochastic signal from the mergers of supermassive black hole binaries ({$\sim$}10-15 strain at f = 1 yr-1). These limits suggest that binary merger rates have been overestimated, or that environmental influences from nuclear gas or stars accelerate orbital decay, reducing the gravitational-wave signal at the lowest, most sensitive frequencies. This prompts the question whether nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) are likely to be detected in the near future. In this Letter, we answer this question quantitatively using simple statistical estimates, deriving the range of true signal amplitudes that are compatible with current upper limits, and computing expected detection probabilities as a function of observation time. We conclude that small arrays consisting of the pulsars with the least timing noise, which yield the tightest upper limits, have discouraging prospects of making a detection in the next two decades. By contrast, we find large arrays are crucial to detection because the quadrupolar spatial correlations induced by GWs can be well sampled by many pulsar pairs. Indeed, timing programs that monitor a large and expanding set of pulsars have an {$\sim$}80\% probability of detecting GWs within the next 10 years, under assumptions on merger rates and environmental influences ranging from optimistic to conservative. Even in the extreme case where 90\% of binaries stall before merger and environmental coupling effects diminish low-frequency gravitational-wave power, detection is delayed by at most a few years.},

We have used a Bayesian analysis in the time domain, accelerated using the recently developed ABC-method which consists of a form of lossy linear data compression. The TOAs were first processed with Tempo2, where the design matrix was extracted for use in a subsequent Bayesian analysis. We used different noise models to analyse the datasets: no red noise, red noise the same for all pulsars, and individual red noise per pulsar. We sampled from the likelihood with four different samplers: "emcee", "t-walk", "Metropolis-Hastings", and "pyMultiNest". All but emcee agreed on the final result, with emcee failing due to artefacts of the high-dimensionality of the problem. An interesting issue we ran into was that the prior of all the 36 (red) noise amplitudes strongly affects the results. A flat prior in the noise amplitude biases the inferred GWB amplitude, whereas a flat prior in log-amplitude seems to work well. This issue is only apparent when using a noise model with individually modelled red noise for all pulsars. Our results for the blind challenges are in good agreement with the injected values. For the GWB amplitudes we found h\_c = 1.03 +/- 0.11 [10{\textasciicircum}\{-14\}], h\_c = 5.70 +/- 0.35 [10{\textasciicircum}\{-14\}], and h\_c = 6.91 +/- 1.72 [10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}], and for the GWB spectral index we found gamma = 4.28 +/- 0.20, gamma = 4.35 +/- 0.09, and gamma = 3.75 +/- 0.40. We note that for closed challenge 3 there was quite some covariance between the signal and the red noise: if we constrain the GWB spectral index to the usual choice of gamma = 13/3, we obtain the estimates: h\_c = 10.0 +/- 0.64 [10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}], h\_c = 56.3 +/- 2.42 [10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}], and h\_c = 4.83 +/- 0.50 [10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}], with one-sided 2 sigma upper-limits of: h\_c {$<$}= 10.98 [10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}], h\_c {$<$}= 60.29 [10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}], and h\_c {$<$}= 5.65 [10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}].},

We therefore place upper limits on the strain of potential gravitational wave memory events as a function of sky location and observing epoch. We find upper limits that are not always more constraining than previous NANOGrav results. We show that it is likely due to the increase in common red noise between the 12.5-year and 15-year NANOGrav datasets.},

  abstract = {We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars from the 15 yr pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings--Downs pattern expected for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power-law spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess of 1014, and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law spectrum model with Bayes factors of 200--1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical background distribution for the latter Bayes factors using a method that removes interpulsar correlations from our data set, finding p = 10-3 ({$\approx$}3{$\sigma$}) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of interpulsar correlations yields p = 5 {\texttimes} 10-5 to 1.9 {\texttimes} 10-4 ({$\approx$}3.5{$\sigma$}--4{$\sigma$}). Assuming a fiducial f -2/3 characteristic strain spectrum, as appropriate for an ensemble of binary supermassive black hole inspirals, the strain amplitude is (median + 90\% credible interval) at a reference frequency of 1 yr-1. The inferred gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations for a signal from a population of supermassive black hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings--Downs correlations points to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.},

  abstract = {Evidence for a low-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background has recently been reported based on analyses of pulsar timing array data. The most likely source of such a background is a population of supermassive black hole binaries, the loudest of which may be individually detected in these data sets. Here we present the search for individual supermassive black hole binaries in the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. We introduce several new techniques, which enhance the efficiency and modeling accuracy of the analysis. The search uncovered weak evidence for two candidate signals, one with a gravitational-wave frequency of {$\sim$}4 nHz, and another at {$\sim$}170 nHz. The significance of the low-frequency candidate was greatly diminished when Hellings--Downs correlations were included in the background model. The high-frequency candidate was discounted due to the lack of a plausible host galaxy, the unlikely astrophysical prior odds of finding such a source, and since most of its support comes from a single pulsar with a commensurate binary period. Finding no compelling evidence for signals from individual binary systems, we place upper limits on the strain amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by such systems. At our most sensitive frequency of 6 nHz, we place a sky-averaged 95\% upper limit of 8 {\texttimes} 10-15 on the strain amplitude. We also calculate an exclusion volume and a corresponding effective radius, within which we can rule out the presence of black hole binaries emitting at a given frequency.},

  abstract = {Pulsar timing array observations have found evidence for an isotropic gravitational wave background with the Hellings-Downs angular correlations, expected from general relativity. This interpretation hinges on the measured shape of the angular correlations, which is predominately quadrupolar under general relativity. Here we explore a more flexible parameterization: we expand the angular correlations into a sum of Legendre polynomials and use a Bayesian analysis to constrain their coefficients with the 15-year pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). When including Legendre polynomials with multipoles \${\textbackslash}ell {\textbackslash}geq 2\$, we only find a significant signal in the quadrupole with an amplitude consistent with general relativity and non-zero at the \${\textbackslash}sim 95{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence level and a Bayes factor of 200. When we include multipoles \${\textbackslash}ell {\textbackslash}leq 1\$, the Bayes factor evidence for quadrupole correlations decreases by more than an order of magnitude due to evidence for a monopolar signal at approximately 4 nHz which has also been noted in previous analyses of the NANOGrav 15-year data. Further work needs to be done in order to better characterize the properties of this monopolar signal and its effect on the evidence for quadrupolar angular correlations.},

  abstract = {The NANOGrav 15 yr data provide compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies. The simplest model-independent approach to characterizing the frequency spectrum of this signal consists of a simple power-law fit involving two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index {$\gamma$}. In this Letter, we consider the next logical step beyond this minimal spectral model, allowing for a running (i.e., logarithmic frequency dependence) of the spectral index, . We fit this running-power-law (RPL) model to the NANOGrav 15 yr data and perform a Bayesian model comparison with the minimal constant-power-law (CPL) model, which results in a 95\% credible interval for the parameter {$\beta$} consistent with no running, , and an inconclusive Bayes factor, . We thus conclude that, at present, the minimal CPL model still suffices to adequately describe the NANOGrav signal; however, future data sets may well lead to a measurement of nonzero {$\beta$}. Finally, we interpret the RPL model as a description of primordial GWs generated during cosmic inflation, which allows us to combine our results with upper limits from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA.},

We also developed a technique to determine the significance of a particular signal in each pulsar using ``dropout'' parameters as a way of identifying spurious signals. From these upper limits, we ruled out SMBHBs emitting GWs with = 8 nHz within 120 Mpc for , and within 5.5 Gpc for at our most sensitive sky location. We also determined that there are no SMBHBs with emitting GWs with = 2.8--317.8 nHz in the Virgo Cluster. Finally, we compared our strain upper limits to simulated populations of SMBHBs, based on galaxies in the Two Micron All-Sky Survey and merger rates from the Illustris cosmological simulation project, and found that only 34 out of 75,000 realizations of the local universe contained a detectable source.},

  abstract = {The mergers of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) promise to be incredible sources of gravitational waves (GWs). While the oscillatory part of the merger gravitational waveform will be outside the frequency sensitivity range of pulsar timing arrays, the nonoscillatory GW memory effect is detectable. Further, any burst of GWs will produce GW memory, making memory a useful probe of unmodeled exotic sources and new physics. We searched the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 11 yr data set for GW memory. This data set is sensitive to very low-frequency GWs of {$\sim$}3 to 400 nHz (periods of {$\sim$}11 yr--1 month). Finding no evidence for GWs, we placed limits on the strain amplitude of GW memory events during the observation period. We then used the strain upper limits to place limits on the rate of GW memory causing events. At a strain of 2.5 {\texttimes} 10-14, corresponding to the median upper limit as a function of source sky position, we set a limit on the rate of GW memory events at {$<$}0.4 yr-1. That strain corresponds to an SMBHB merger with reduced mass of {$\eta$}M {$\sim$} 2 {\texttimes} 1010 and inclination of {$\iota$} = {$\pi$}/3 at a distance of 1 Gpc. As a test of our analysis, we analyzed the NANOGrav 9 yr data set as well. This analysis found an anomolous signal, which does not appear in the 11 yr data set. This signal is not a GW, and its origin remains unknown.},

Furthermore, we place 95\% sky-averaged lower limits on the luminosity distance to such gravitational wave sources, finding that dL {$\greaterequivlnt$} 425 Mpc for sources at a frequency of 10 nHz and chirp mass 1010 M{$\Sun$}. We find that for gravitational wave sources near our best timed pulsars in the sky, the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array is increased by a factor of {$\sim$}four over the sky-averaged sensitivity. Finally we place limits on the coalescence rate of the most massive supermassive black hole binaries.},

  abstract = {We search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) in the newly released 11 year data set from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). While we find no evidence for a GWB, we place constraints on a population of inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, a network of decaying cosmic strings, and a primordial GWB. For the first time, we find that the GWB constraints are sensitive to the solar system ephemeris (SSE) model used and that SSE errors can mimic a GWB signal. We developed an approach that bridges systematic SSE differences, producing the first pulsar-timing array (PTA) constraints that are robust against SSE errors. We thus place a 95\% upper limit on the GW-strain amplitude of AGWB {$<$} 1.45 {\texttimes} 10-15 at a frequency of f = 1 yr-1 for a fiducial f-2/3 power-law spectrum and with interpulsar correlations modeled. This is a factor of {$\sim$}2 improvement over the NANOGrav nine-year limit calculated using the same procedure. Previous PTA upper limits on the GWB (as well as their astrophysical and cosmological interpretations) will need revision in light of SSE systematic errors. We use our constraints to characterize the combined influence on the GWB of the stellar mass density in galactic cores, the eccentricity of SMBH binaries, and SMBH--galactic-bulge scaling relationships. We constrain the cosmic-string tension using recent simulations, yielding an SSE-marginalized 95\% upper limit of G{$\mu$} {$<$} 5.3 {\texttimes} 10-11---a factor of {$\sim$}2 better than the published NANOGrav nine-year constraints. Our SSE-marginalized 95\% upper limit on the energy density of a primordial GWB (for a radiation-dominated post-inflation universe) is {\textohm}GWB(f) h2 {$<$} 3.4 {\texttimes} 10-10.},

  abstract = {We present high-precision timing data over time spans of up to 11 years for 45 millisecond pulsars observed as part of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) project, aimed at detecting and characterizing low-frequency gravitational waves. The pulsars were observed with the Arecibo Observatory and/or the Green Bank Telescope at frequencies ranging from 327 MHz to 2.3 GHz. Most pulsars were observed with approximately monthly cadence, and six high-timing-precision pulsars were observed weekly. All were observed at widely separated frequencies at each observing epoch in order to fit for time-variable dispersion delays. We describe our methods for data processing, time-of-arrival (TOA) calculation, and the implementation of a new, automated method for removing outlier TOAs. We fit a timing model for each pulsar that includes spin, astrometric, and (for binary pulsars) orbital parameters; time-variable dispersion delays; and parameters that quantify pulse-profile evolution with frequency. The timing solutions provide three new parallax measurements, two new Shapiro delay measurements, and two new measurements of significant orbital-period variations. We fit models that characterize sources of noise for each pulsar. We find that 11 pulsars show significant red noise, with generally smaller spectral indices than typically measured for non-recycled pulsars, possibly suggesting a different origin. A companion paper uses these data to constrain the strength of the gravitational-wave background.},

The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) observes dozens of the most stable millisecond pulsars using the Arecibo and Green Bank radio telescopes in an effort to study, among other things, gravitational wave memory. We herein present the results of a search for gravitational wave bursts with memory (BWMs) using the first five years of NANOGrav observations. We develop original methods for dramatically speeding up searches for BWM signals. In the directions of the sky where our sensitivity to BWMs is best, we would detect mergers of binaries with reduced masses of out to distances of 30 Mpc; such massive mergers in the Virgo cluster would be marginally detectable. We find no evidence for BWMs. However, with our non-detection, we set upper limits on the rate at which BWMs of various amplitudes could have occurred during the time spanned by our data---e.g., BWMs with amplitudes greater than 10-13 must encounter the Earth at a rate less than 1.5 yr-1.},

The time of arrival data are fit to a physical timing model for each source, including terms that characterize time-variable dispersion measure and frequency-dependent pulse shape evolution. In conjunction with the timing model fit, we have performed a Bayesian analysis of a parameterized timing noise model for each source, and detect evidence for excess low-frequency, or ``red,'' timing noise in 10 of the pulsars. For 5 of these cases this is likely due to interstellar medium propagation effects rather than intrisic spin variations.

Using the broken power-law analysis we construct posterior distributions on environmental factors that drive the binary to the GW-driven regime including the stellar mass density for stellar-scattering, mass accretion rate for circumbinary disk interaction, and orbital eccentricity for eccentric binaries, marking the first time that the shape of the GWB spectrum has been used to make astrophysical inferences. Returning to a power-law model, we place stringent limits on the energy density of relic GWs, .

We develop frequentist and Bayesian detection algorithms to search both for monochromatic and frequency-evolving systems. None of the adopted algorithms show evidence for the presence of such a CGW signal, indicating that the data are best described by pulsar and radiometer noise only. Depending on the adopted detection algorithm, the 95~per~cent upper limit on the sky-averaged strain amplitude lies in the range 6 {\texttimes} 10-15 \&lt; A \&lt; 1.5 {\texttimes} 10-14 at 5\,nHz \&lt; f \&lt; 7\,nHz. This limit varies by a factor of five, depending on the assumed source position and the most constraining limit is achieved towards the positions of the most sensitive pulsars in the timing array. The most robust upper limit -- obtained via a full Bayesian analysis searching simultaneously over the signal and pulsar noise on the subset of ours six best pulsars -- is A {$\approx$} 10-14. These limits, the most stringent to date at f \&lt; 10\,nHz, exclude the presence of sub-centiparsec binaries with chirp mass \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}\&gt;10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ out to a distance of about 25~Mpc, and with \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}\&gt;10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ out to a distance of about 1Gpc (z {$\approx$} 0.2). We show that state-of-the-art SMBHB population models predict \&lt;1\,per\,cent probability of detecting a CGW with the current EPTA data set, consistent with the reported non-detection. We stress, however, that PTA limits on individual CGW have improved by almost an order of magnitude in the last five years. The continuing advances in pulsar timing data acquisition and analysis techniques will allow for strong astrophysical constraints on the population of nearby SMBHBs in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Analyses of pulsar timing data have provided evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background in the nanohertz frequency band. The most plausible source of this background is the superposition of signals from millions of supermassive black hole binaries. The standard statistical techniques used to search for this background and assess its significance make several simplifying assumptions, namely (i) Gaussianity, (ii) isotropy, and most often, (iii) a power-law spectrum. However, a stochastic background from a finite collection of binaries does not exactly satisfy any of these assumptions. To understand the effect of these assumptions, we test standard analysis techniques on a large collection of realistic simulated data sets. The data-set length, observing schedule, and noise levels were chosen to emulate the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. Simulated signals from millions of binaries drawn from models based on the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamical simulation were added to the data. We find that the standard statistical methods perform remarkably well on these simulated data sets, even though their fundamental assumptions are not strictly met. They are able to achieve a confident detection of the background. However, even for a fixed set of astrophysical parameters, different realizations of the universe result in a large variance in the significance and recovered parameters of the background. We also find that the presence of loud individual binaries can bias the spectral recovery of the background if we do not account for them.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of Pulsar Timing Arrays to gravitational waves (GWs) depends on the noise present in the individual pulsar timing data. Noise may be either intrinsic or extrinsic to the pulsar. Intrinsic sources of noise will include rotational instabilities, for example. Extrinsic sources of noise include contributions from physical processes which are not sufficiently well modelled, for example, dispersion and scattering effects, analysis errors and instrumental instabilities. We present the results from a noise analysis for 42 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) observed with the European Pulsar Timing Array. For characterizing the low-frequency, stochastic and achromatic noise component, or `timing noise', we employ two methods, based on Bayesian and frequentist statistics. For 25 MSPs, we achieve statistically significant measurements of their timing noise parameters and find that the two methods give consistent results. For the remaining 17 MSPs, we place upper limits on the timing noise amplitude at the 95~per~cent confidence level. We additionally place an upper limit on the contribution to the pulsar noise budget from errors in the reference terrestrial time standards (below 1~per~cent), and we find evidence for a noise component which is present only in the data of one of the four used telescopes. Finally, we estimate that the timing noise of individual pulsars reduces the sensitivity of this data set to an isotropic, stochastic GW background by a factor of \&gt;9.1 and by a factor of \&gt;2.3 for continuous GWs from resolvable, inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries with circular orbits.},

  abstract = {Pulsar-timing analyses are sensitive to errors in the Solar-system ephemerides (SSEs) that timing models utilize to estimate the location of the Solar-system barycentre, the quasi-inertial reference frame to which all recorded pulse times-of-arrival are referred. Any error in the SSE will affect all pulsars, therefore pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are a suitable tool to search for such errors and impose independent constraints on relevant physical parameters. We employ the first data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array to constrain the masses of the planet--moons systems and to search for possible unmodelled objects (UMOs) in the Solar system. We employ 10 SSEs from two independent research groups, derive and compare mass constraints of planetary systems, and derive the first PTA mass constraints on asteroid-belt objects. Constraints on planetary-system masses have been improved by factors of up to 20 from the previous relevant study using the same assumptions, with the mass of the Jovian system measured at 9.5479189(3) {\texttimes} 10-4\,M{$\odot$}. The mass of the dwarf planet Ceres is measured at 4.7(4) {\texttimes} 10-10\,M{$\odot$}. We also present the first sensitivity curves using real data that place generic limits on the masses of UMOs, which can also be used as upper limits on the mass of putative exotic objects. For example, upper limits on dark-matter clumps are comparable to published limits using independent methods. While the constraints on planetary masses derived with all employed SSEs are consistent, we note and discuss differences in the associated timing residuals and UMO sensitivity curves.},

  abstract = {The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally aligns with predictions from orbital evolution driven by gravitational wave emission in circular orbits, there is a discernible preference for a turnover at the lowest observed frequencies. This turnover could indicate a significant hardening phase, transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages predominantly influenced by gravitational wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we assess how the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to disruption by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. Our findings suggest a parsec-scale galactic center density around \$10{\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot/{\textbackslash}textrm\{pc\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ across most of the parameter space, offering insights into the environmental effects on black hole evolution and combined matter density near galaxy centers.},

  abstract = {We report on the high-precision timing of 42 radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) observed by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). This EPTA Data Release 1.0 extends up to mid-2014 and baselines range from 7--18~yr. It forms the basis for the stochastic gravitational-wave background, anisotropic background, and continuous-wave limits recently presented by the EPTA elsewhere. The Bayesian timing analysis performed with temponest yields the detection of several new parameters: seven parallaxes, nine proper motions and, in the case of six binary pulsars, an apparent change of the semimajor axis. We find the NE2001 Galactic electron density model to be a better match to our parallax distances (after correction from the Lutz--Kelker bias) than the M2 and M3 models by Schnitzeler. However, we measure an average uncertainty of 80~per~cent (fractional) for NE2001, three times larger than what is typically assumed in the literature. We revisit the transverse velocity distribution for a set of 19 isolated and 57 binary MSPs and find no statistical difference between these two populations. We detect Shapiro delay in the timing residuals of PSRs J1600-3053 and J1918-0642, implying pulsar and companion masses \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm p\}=1.22\_\{-0.35\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.5\}{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\$, \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\} = 0.21\_\{-0.04\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.06\}{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}odot \} \}\$ and \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm p\}=1.25\_\{-0.4\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.6\}{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\$, \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\} = 0.23\_\{-0.05\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}odot \} \}\$, respectively. Finally, we use the measurement of the orbital period derivative to set a stringent constraint on the distance to PSRs J1012+5307 and J1909-3744, and set limits on the longitude of ascending node through the search of the annual-orbital parallax for PSRs J1600-3053 and J1909-3744.},

  abstract = {An ensemble of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries should produce a stochastic background of very low frequency gravitational waves. This stochastic background is predicted to be a power law, with a gravitational-wave strain spectral index of -2/3, and it should be detectable by a network of precisely timed millisecond pulsars, widely distributed on the sky. This paper reports a new ``time slicing'' analysis of the 11 yr data release from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) using 34 millisecond pulsars. Methods to flag potential ``false-positive'' signatures are developed, including techniques to identify responsible pulsars. Mitigation strategies are then presented. We demonstrate how an incorrect noise model can lead to spurious signals, and we show how independently modeling noise across 30 Fourier components, spanning NANOGrav's frequency range, effectively diagnoses and absorbs the excess power in gravitational-wave searches. This results in a nominal, and expected, progression of our gravitational-wave statistics. Additionally, we show that the first interstellar medium event in PSR J1713+0747 pollutes the common red-noise process with low spectral index noise, and we use a tailored noise model to remove these effects.},

We used two analysis techniques with independent estimates of the noise models for the pulsar observations and different algorithms for obtaining the pulsar time-scale. The two analyses agree within the estimated uncertainties and both agree with TT(BIPM17), a post-corrected time-scale produced by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). We show that both methods could detect significant errors in TT(BIPM17) if they were present. We estimate the stability of the atomic clocks from which TT(BIPM17) is derived using observations of four rubidium fountain clocks at the US Naval Observatory. Comparing the power spectrum of TT(IPTA16) with that of these fountain clocks suggests that pulsar-based time-scales are unlikely to contribute to the stability of the best time-scales over the next decade, but they will remain a valuable independent check on atomic time-scales. We also find that the stability of the pulsar-based time-scale is likely to be limited by our knowledge of solar-system dynamics, and that errors in TT(BIPM17) will not be a limiting factor for the primary goal of the IPTA, which is to search for the signatures of nano-Hertz gravitational waves.},

We use Bayesian methodology, performing model selection to determine the optimal description of the stochastic signals present in each pulsar. In addition to spin-noise and dispersion-measure (DM) variations, these models can include timing noise unique to a single observing system, or frequency band. We show the improved radio-frequency coverage and presence of overlapping data from different observing systems in the IPTA data set enables us to separate both system and band-dependent effects with much greater efficacy than in the individual pulsar timing array (PTA) data sets. For example, we show that PSR~J1643-1224 has, in addition to DM variations, significant band-dependent noise that is coherent between PTAs which we interpret as coming from time-variable scattering or refraction in the ionized interstellar medium. Failing to model these different contributions appropriately can dramatically alter the astrophysical interpretation of the stochastic signals observed in the residuals. In some cases, the spectral exponent of the spin-noise signal can vary from 1.6 to 4 depending upon the model, which has direct implications for the long-term sensitivity of the pulsar to a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. By using a more appropriate model, however, we can greatly improve a pulsar's sensitivity to GWs. For example, including system and band-dependent signals in the PSR~J0437-4715 data set improves the upper limit on a fiducial GW background by~{$\sim$}60\,per\,cent compared to a model that includes DM variations and spin-noise only.},

  abstract = {A new Bayesian software package for the analysis of pulsar timing data is presented in the form of temponest which allows for the robust determination of the non-linear pulsar timing solution simultaneously with a range of additional stochastic parameters. This includes both red spin noise and dispersion measure variations using either power-law descriptions of the noise, or through a model-independent method that parametrizes the power at individual frequencies in the signal. We use temponest to show that at noise levels representative of current data sets in the European Pulsar Timing Array and International Pulsar Timing Array the linear timing model can underestimate the uncertainties of the timing solution by up to an order of magnitude. We also show how to perform Bayesian model selection between different sets of timing model and stochastic parameters, for example, by demonstrating that in the pulsar B1937+21 both the dispersion measure variations and spin noise in the data are optimally modelled by simple power laws. Finally, we show that not including the stochastic parameters simultaneously with the timing model can lead to unpredictable variation in the estimated uncertainties, compromising the robustness of the scientific results extracted from such analysis.},

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, the measurement precision of some pulsar timing experiments has advanced from {$\sim$}10 {$\mu$}s to {$\sim$}10 ns, revealing many subtle phenomena. Such high precision demands both careful data handling and sophisticated timing models to avoid systematic error. To achieve these goals, we present PINT (PINT Is Not T empo3), a high-precision Python pulsar timing data analysis package, which is hosted on GitHub and available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) as pint-pulsar. PINT is well tested, validated, object oriented, and modular, enabling interactive data analysis and providing an extensible and flexible development platform for timing applications. It utilizes well-debugged public Python packages (e.g., the NumPy and Astropy libraries) and modern software development schemes (e.g., version control and efficient development with git and GitHub) and a continually expanding test suite for improved reliability, accuracy, and reproducibility. PINT is developed and implemented without referring to, copying, or transcribing the code from other traditional pulsar timing software packages (e.g., Tempo/Tempo2) and therefore provides a robust tool for cross-checking timing analyses and simulating pulse arrival times. In this paper, we describe the design, use, and validation of PINT, and we compare timing results between it and Tempo and Tempo2.},

  abstract = {The highly stable spin of neutron stars can be exploited for a variety of (astro)physical investigations. In particular, arrays of pulsars with rotational periods of the order of milliseconds can be used to detect correlated signals such as those caused by gravitational waves. Three such `pulsar timing arrays' (PTAs) have been set up around the world over the past decades and collectively form the `International' PTA (IPTA). In this paper, we describe the first joint analysis of the data from the three regional PTAs, i.e. of the first IPTA data set. We describe the available PTA data, the approach presently followed for its combination and suggest improvements for future PTA research. Particular attention is paid to subtle details (such as underestimation of measurement uncertainty and long-period noise) that have often been ignored but which become important in this unprecedentedly large and inhomogeneous data set. We identify and describe in detail several factors that complicate IPTA research and provide recommendations for future pulsar timing efforts. The first IPTA data release presented here (and available online) is used to demonstrate the IPTA's potential of improving upon gravitational-wave limits placed by individual PTAs by a factor of {$\sim$}2 and provides a 2{$\sigma$} limit on the dimensionless amplitude of a stochastic gravitational-wave background of 1.7 {\texttimes} 10-15 at a frequency of 1\,yr-1. This is 1.7~times less constraining than the limit placed by Shannon et~al., due mostly to the more recent, high-quality data they used.},
